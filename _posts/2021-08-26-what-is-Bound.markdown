# What is Bound?
<h1 class="subtitle">(and the state of the game I want to aim for!)</h1>
<!-- excerpt_start -->
Bound is the game I've been "looking for". That would be how I want to say it.
It is a game with an excellent combat system, with multiple classes, each with its abilities and play styles. 

I'd love A few different weapon types, a variety of abilities and being able to explore a world and have some fun. I want a lot in this game, and I hope to detail a lot of it here so it can be a base for you (and me) to see what this game will become!

We are starting with the Combat System!
<!-- excerpt_end -->
## Combat System

### Weapons:
The combat system will have different types of weapons, each having combos and potentially unique interaction and abilities.

Any character can use any weapon. For example, a huntress could use a bow, but they can also use a dagger, scythe, or even a grimoire! The different weapons' goal is to expand our playstyle and allow players to pick and choose what they want for gameplay and fashion.

### Combos:

The second part of the combat system would be the combo system, and this will mainly apply to your weapon and its combos and interaction with enemies! This part aims to have excellent flowing combat that feels good and has a little bit of variety! Some weapons would be hitting at a more extended range than others, whilst others doing more damage.

## Classes

I would love to have multiple classes in the game, starting with just a few (for obvious reasons). The first class will be the huntress. I can confirm that. Each of the classes will have a unique set of abilities, which synergies with each other and potentially other classes and weapons. I want a few different classes that can perform better in some places than others, such as being able to support better or tank hits better and so on!

## Dungeon Crawling/Raiding

Having a mix of content that is mechanic heavy to content that is more of a combat experience is something I'd love to have. 

For example, you have a dungeon which is a fighting arena of some sort. In this dungeon, you are tasked to fight for as long as possible, duelling enemies with your weapon and with raw class power to acquire rewards! 

And for the mechanic heavy dungeon, you might have to position yourself to a spot on the map to bait the boss or the need to apply a debuff to the boss.

The feeling of raiding or completing high level/challenging dungeons is the kind of feel that I want to replicate while maintaining an enjoyable and smooth experience.

## Questing

Questing is a crucial factor to Bound, as it will help players learn and interact with the world-building, game systems, lore and showing the player additional content within the game! 

I'd love to have lore-based quests and gameplay based quests. A good variety of both is what I want! But I can't jump the gun, so simple quest and quest steps will be in the game, showing functionality and proving the concept.

## Simple Multiplayer

There isn't all too much to say about this one. Simple multiplayer will be Peer-to-Peer networking, allowing players to play together in the world and activities. 

This feature is at the bottom of the barrel, but it is one that I want in the game. The idea of playing this game with some friends is one that I want to have!

# What's beyond?
<h1 class="subtitle">(I would LOVE to have, but won't work on till at least everything else is working!)</h1>

Well... There are always going to be those kinds of things that would be cool to have, fun to play with, but aren't possible or would hinder the development much greater than doing good in the end.

That doesn't mean they won't ever be added if given a chance, but they cannot be added at this current stage in time, nor are there plans to.

## Open World

An open world to explore is something I've always loved, and if ever possible, I wouldn't hesitate to add it to this game. Just the thought of exploring a world with hints of lore and activities is something that gets me excited. But again, this is something that won't be added till after everything else has been developed.

## Improved Multiplayer Servers/Dedicated Servers

I've already talked about multiplayer servers, but this is for an improved version built on the above feature. As well as an enhanced Peer-to-Peer system, being able to host a dedicated server for those looking for a better experience is something I'd love to have! 

Instead of having the Peer host machine put in all the work, this server could run off another device (including cloud services), improving gameplay, consistency, and connectivity.

# So, Where are we at?

Well, you can see that in the Discord and Trello board!
- <a href="{{ site.discord_link }}">Discord</a>
- <a href="https://trello.com/b/SieEloKO/bound">Trello</a>


Both of these will have updates of their own, The discord will have me talking more about it all/previews, and Trello gives the guidelines on where the game is headed and where it is at!
